	<h1>MDL Editor and Converter Toolbox</h1>
	<p><strong>The Drug Disease Model Resources (DDMoRe) consortium builds and maintains a universally applicable, open source, model based framework, intended as the gold standard for future collaborative drug and disease Modelling &amp; Simulation.</strong>
	</p>
	<h2>About MDL Editor</h2>
	<p>
		MDL Editor is an xText-based Eclipse plugin for Model Description Language (MDL), 
		a domain-specific-language for drug modeling. MDL code is automatically converted 
		to the code in interoperable language - Model Mark-up Language (MML) - and, eventually, to executable models (e.g., NM-TRAN). 
		MDL has two components:
		<ul>
			<li>Model Coding Language (MCL): The MCL is used to define models together with their parameters,data and re-usable tasks.
    			<li>Task Execution Language (TEL):  The TEL is used to describe how the input from the MCL will be used to perform an analysis task e.g. parameter estimation.
		</ul>
	</p>	
	<p>
		The MDL and MML language specifications are still work in progress.
		The MDL Editor currently supports: 
		<ul>
			<li> Syntactic validation of the recent MCL draft
			<li> Conversion of a subset of MCL models directly to NM-TRAN  
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>	
	<ul>
		<li>Browse the <a href="http://www.ddmore.eu/">DDMoRe project</a> web site for the information on the purpose and the goals of the Interoperability Framework.
		<li>Learn about the MDL and MML languages from DDMoRe deliverables and publications
		<li>Install and try the MDL Editor and converting tools
	        <li>Get involved by providing your feedback
	</ul>
	<p>
		If you have experience with NM-TRAN/NONMEM, try the <a href="http://nmtran-to-mdl.mango-solutions.com/">NM-TRAN to MDL Converter Tool</a>
		to see how equivalent models look in MDL.	
	</p>	

	<h2>Installation and configuration</h2>
	<p>
		The MDL Editor plug-in can be installed using the update manager of Eclipse. The following software is required to run the tools:
	        <ul>
		<li> Java 6 or higher
		<li> Eclipse with xText/xTend support. The recent version can be obtained from the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/download.html">xText web site.</a>  
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		To install the MDL Editor, add a new remote update site in the update manager using the below URL. 
		For updating an exisiting installation, click on Check for updates in the Help menu of Eclipse. 
		During the installation you may receive a warning about installing unsigned content - this is normal, just press OK for now.
	</p>
	<blockquote><strong>MDL Editor update web site:</strong> https://sourceforge.net/projects/ddmore/files/update/mdleditor</blockquote>
	<p>
		If you have any issues with the installation, please contact Natallia Kokash (natallia.kokash@gmail.com).
	</p>
	<h2>Working with the editor</h2>
	<p>
		After installation, create a Java project and add files to it with extension .mdl; The first time you do so, the tool will ask if you want to associate the 
		xText feature with this extension - answer 'Yes' to enable MDL Editor plug-in.
		If you want to add existing files from your file system to the project, select File -> New -> File, press Advanced and select checkbox "Link to file in the file system", select your files and press Finish.
		To import external files or projects to your working environment you can also use menu File -> Import.
	</p>
	<p>
		The validated MDL files will be converted to NM-TRAN automatically every time you save them after modification.
		You can find the result files in the folder "src-gen" (if such folder does not exist in your project and does not appear automatically at the beginning, create it manually using menu File -> New -> Source Folder).
	</p>
	<p>
		To generate an NM-TRAN file, the converter applies a predefined set of conversion rules to MDL constructs that meet certain conditions. 
		If some rule is missing or the MDL specification does not adhere to modeling conventions, it is quite possible that the generated NONMEM file may be wrong.
                Our goal is to cover all the situations needed in practice and provide a correct conversion of such models from MDL to NM-TRAN, so
		if you find a problem with your model, please let us know.	  
	</p>
	<p>
		The presented converter tool was tested on the following set of NONMEM control files:
		<blockquote>Download <a href="Samples/nt-original.zip">original NM-TRAN models (.zip)</a></blockquote>
		After the conversion using <a href="http://nmtran-to-mdl.mango-solutions.com/">NM-TRAN to MDL coonversion tool</a> the following set of MDL files has been produced:
		<blockquote>Download <a href="Samples/mdl-samples.zip">generated MDL models (.zip)</a></blockquote>
		NM-TRAN files reconstrcuted from the aforementioned set of MDL specifications:
		<blockquote>Download <a href="Samples/nt-generated.zip">generated NM-TRAN models (.zip)</a></blockquote>
