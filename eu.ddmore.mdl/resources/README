Place resources files such as images in this folder.
Make sure they are under a package structure that matches the src structure.
Specifically, do not place files directly at the top-level since they will then be placed into the jar file at the top level and this can cause problems.


NOTE: Do not delete this file until this directory has some actual content, since Git cannot deal with empty directories.
