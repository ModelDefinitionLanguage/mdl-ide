	<!-- Note that the version number of this Feature is deliberately fixed (i.e. not having a .qualifier suffix)
	     since otherwise the Feature will attempt to be updated each time an update is performed within the MDL IDE
	     and this will fail due to the JRE being in use (by the MDL IDE itself) and thus not replaceable by the
	     update process (even if the JRE hasn't physically changed; the contents of a Feature are always replaced
	     by the P2 update). -->
